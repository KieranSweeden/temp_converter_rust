# temp_converter

This is a tiny temperature converter command line program that prompts the user to enter a target temperature unit to convert to (either being Fahrenheit or Celsius) & a number.

Provided the values entered are valid, it will then convert the number to the target temperature unit assuming the number provided is of the opposing temperature unit type.

The purpose of this is to learn the basics of the Rust programming language after reading up to chapter 4 in [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).
